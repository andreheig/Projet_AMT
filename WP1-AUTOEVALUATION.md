| Description                                                  | Functional / non-functional | Points | Done/ Not done | Comment (Optional)                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ------ | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| As an **application developer**, I can access the web UI and register with the gamification service (create a `developer account`). I provide basic info (`name`, etc.), my `e-mail address` is my user identifier. | FR                          | 0.5 | Done | |
| As an **application developer**, I can login and logout from the gamification service web UI. When I login, I have access to my profile information and to my list of applications. When I have logged out and try to access a protected page, I am redirected to the login page. | FR |0.5| Done | |
| As an **application developer**, I can manage my applications (CRUD operations). Every application has at least a `name`, a `description`, an `API key` and an `API secret` (the last 2 are unique and generated by the service). | FR                          | 0.5 | Done | |
| As an **administrator**, I can see a list of registered application developers, with their details. The user interface is designed to work well even if the application developer has created 1'000 applications (pagination). | FR                          | 0.5  | Done | |
| As an **administrator**, I can suspend an account. When the developer tries to login, he is blocked and sees an informative error message. | FR                          | 0.5  | Done | |
| As an **administrator**, I can reset a user password. The password is automatically generated and sent by e-mail to the application developer. When the developer logs in, he is obliged to change his password immediately. | FR |0.5 | Done | |
| As an user (administrator or developer) i can reset my password (forget password fonctionnality) | FR |0.5 | Done | |
| As an application developer i can add other developer to my application project | FR |0.5 | | |
| | **Total** | **4.0** |||
| As a **user**, I have a good UI/UX experience (nice design, clear navigation, informative error messages, etc.) | NFR-usability |0.5 | Half-Done | |
| As a **spiritual guide**, I can clone the repo, move to a documented repository and type `docker-compose up` to start the system. I can then access it with my browser. | NFR-maintainability         | 0.5  | Done | Maybe version of docker-compose can make problem, 3.7 works on windows. docker version 3.5 & Payara 5.183 works on linux |
| As a **spiritual guide**, I find a report named `TESTING_FUNCTIONAL.md` which describes how to execute **automated functional tests**. At the minimum, there should be a scenario with the following steps: developer creates an account, developer logs in, developer creates 25 pages, developer browses the list of applications (3 pages of 10, 10 and 5 applications), developer logs out, developer tries to go back to the list of applications and is redirected to login page. The tests should include assertions, so that changing the code (e.g. introducing a bug) breaks the code. The report should describe and document a concrete example (with screenshots). | NFR-testability             | 1.0  | Done | |
| As a **spiritual guide**, I find a report named `TESTING_NON_FUNCTIONAL_PAGINATION.md`which describes which **non-functional tests** have been implemented and run. At the minimum, the report answers this question: "What is the impact of using pagination between the business and the resources tier?". The report should introduce the issue, describe the design of an experiment, document the experimental results and interpret the data. | NFR-testability             | 1.0  | Done | |
| As a spiritual guide, I find a report named `TESTING_NON_FUNCTIONAL_TRANSACTIONS`, which describes an experiment that has been done to prove that transactions work as expected with **Enterprise Java Beans** (especially in the case of rollbacks). The report describes the related code. | NFR-reliability | 1.0  | Done | |
|                                                              | **Total** | **4.0** |||
